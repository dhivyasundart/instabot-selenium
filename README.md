The InstaBot is an automated bot created by Selenium using Jupyter notebook. The bot is designed specifically for a food handle to gain more followers and be popular.

It gets the trending handles for food, analyses the hashtags used the most, number of posts made recently, number of followers, followers: like ratio, extract comments made on photos etc. This data is plotted using matplotlib to obtain appropriate graphs to gather insights. It can also perform functions like liking the pictures, viewing story if not viewed, following the handle and getting list of followers whom you follow.
